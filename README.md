# AWAQ Dashboard
Dashboard to visualize user progress as they go through their OnBoarding process with AWAQ.

## How to run

1. Create the appsettings.json file -> you can use appsettings.json.example as a template. Make sure to provide valid Azure AD values.<br><br>
2. Create the db either locally or in the cloud and provide the connection string at the appsettings.json.<br><br>
3. Run the application using Visual Studio or run the following command in the terminal at the root directory:
```bash
dotnet watch run
```
<br>

4. To run the videogame, the API url will be needed. Either change the localhost url for the IP address of the computer at the Properties/launchSettings.json file or use NGrok to expose the local web server to the internet. After installing and setting up NGrok, use the following command (replacing the <domain> and <port>):
  
```bash
ngrok http --domain=<domain> <port>
```
<br>

5. In Unity, change the API url accordingly and build the game to import it on XCode.
