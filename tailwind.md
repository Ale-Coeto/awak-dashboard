## Using tailwindcss in dotnet

The current setup uses [tailwindcss-dotnet](https://github.com/rozumak/tailwindcss-dotnet).

Steps to run tailwind with current setup:

One time:

```bash
# Install tailwind dotnet tool
dotnet tool install --global tailwindcss-dotnet
tailwind install
```

During runtime (development):
```bash
# Run this command at the webpage project's root. (Dashboard/Dashboard), or specify path with --project [path]
tailwind watch

# Start app hot-reload
# At project's root
dotnet run watch

```

When running 'watch', all files are scanned and tailwind classes are autogenerated and added to `Dashboard\Dashboard\wwwroot\css\app.css`. The file is in the `.gitignore` to avoid merge conflicts and because it can be generated using the mentioned command.

## Recommended Extension

There is a extension for intellisense in [visual studio](https://github.com/theron-wang/VS2022-Editor-Support-for-Tailwind-CSS/tree/main) 🙏.

Install: Extensions > Manage Extensions > Tailwind 
CSS VS2022 Editor Support

Note: intellisense doesn't seem to work with custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`. However, when using those colors, they are generated and added to the app.css output.

## Production

```bash
# Generates wwwroot\css\app.css
tailwind build
```
